Started with the basic troubleshooting by executing some of the following commands
###############################################################################################
uname -a
df -h (Checked the disk space for any issue)
sudo ls -ltr
ls | grep redis
/usr/bin/redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf (Checked with manual run)
sudo vi redis-server.log (Checked with log files)
cd /etc/systemd/system/
redis-cli info 
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog  (Checked with syslog for any system error)
journalctl -xe
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
redis-server --version
redis-cli --version (Checked with version to find the issue)
redis-cli
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 6379 -j ACCEPT  (Checked with firewall connection)
sudo systemctl unmask  redis-server.service
sudo chmod 770 /var/lib/redis
ping google.com (Checked for network connectivity)
sudo systemctl enable redis-server.service 
ps aux |grep redis
netstat -nap |grep 6379 (Checked for port connectivity)
sudo su -
sudo systemctl status redis-server.service
sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart redis-server.service
sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf
sudo systemctl status
sudo systemctl --failed (Checked for systemctl failed status)
sudo systemctl isolate reboot.target (Rebooted the target system to make the changes to apply)
sudo netstat -a -p TCP -n | grep 6379

##############################Tell us what's wrong################################################

Found that the issue is related to kernel systemctl 
Got the error with the command - sudo systemctl status
systemctl status showed degraded units

Then when checked for failed status 
sudo systemctl --failed shows detailed description of redis units failed with degraded issue.

  UNIT                    LOAD   ACTIVE SUB    DESCRIPTION
‚óè redis-server.service    loaded failed failed Advanced key-value store


###########################Explain what you did to fix it#########################################

There is a file in /etc/default/grub (Bootloader), which contains grub setting, in the file there is a kernel variable called crashkernel, the error has to do 
with this setting, auto is default, but depending on how much memory you have auto setting is too big, so setting it to a smaller size (128) makes the error go away. 

After setting the value to crashkernel=128 and rebooting solved the issue. (systemctl isolate reboot.target)

Then checked with the command sudo systemctl status redis-server.service Redis service was running successfully.
